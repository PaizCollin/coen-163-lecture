### Author: Collin Paiz

### Institution: Santa Clara University

### Professor: Dr. Sharon Hsiao

### Session: Spring 2023

## Overview

#### This repository includes various HTML/CSS/React projects from the lab section of COEN 163: Web Usability.

## Final Project - Resonate

#### Build the front-end of a web application using React and Vite using the various UI/UX design principles learned throughout the course. The web application services local physical-media sellers and buyers by providing a platform for them to connect and exchange vinyl records, CDs, etc. The web application, known as "Resonate", would allow users to link their Spotify or Apple Music accounts to curate "collections" of physical music media from various local sellers. Users can then browse other users' collections and contact them to purchase the physical media.
